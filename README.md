This project implements a deep learning-based model for detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI scans as either "Tumor" or "No Tumor." The model is built using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas, with image preprocessing and evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.

Tech Stack:
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
Project Overview:
Brain tumor detection using MRI images is a critical step in the early diagnosis of brain cancer. This AI-driven system aids healthcare professionals in detecting brain tumors with high accuracy, ultimately improving patient outcomes through early intervention. The model leverages deep learning to automatically detect abnormal patterns in brain scans and classify them as either tumor or no-tumor.

Key Features:
Image Preprocessing:

Data augmentation to enhance the model's generalization ability.
Resizing and normalizing images for consistent input.
Grayscale conversion and contrast adjustments using OpenCV for better feature extraction.
Model Architecture:

A CNN-based architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Dropout layers to reduce overfitting during training.
A softmax output layer to classify the images into two categories: "Tumor" or "No Tumor."
Evaluation Metrics:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures how well the model identifies all actual positive cases.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
Model Training and Evaluation:
The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Training involves using cross-entropy loss and an optimizer like Adam or SGD for faster convergence.
Setup and Installation:
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (2.x)
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Steps to Install:
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git
cd Brain-Tumor-Detection
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a set of MRI images stored in an appropriate directory for training and testing.

Run the model training:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py

To predict the presence of a tumor on a new MRI image:

bash
Copy
python predict.py --image_path "path_to_your_mri_image.jpg"
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains MRI images with labeled categories (Tumor or No Tumor). You can use publicly available datasets such as Brain MRI Images Dataset or prepare your own dataset with MRI scans.

Model Results:
The model's performance can be measured using the following evaluation metrics:

Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted tumor cases to all predicted tumor cases.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted tumor cases to all actual tumor cases.
F1-Score: A balanced metric between precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
Future Improvements:
Integrate additional deep learning techniques like transfer learning to further improve accuracy.
Extend the model to handle more tumor types or other brain-related abnormalities.
Explore advanced image preprocessing methods like Histogram Equalization for better feature extraction.
